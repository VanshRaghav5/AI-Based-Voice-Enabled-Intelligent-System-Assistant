# 🧠 AI-Based Voice-Enabled Intelligent System (Windows)

A modular, production-ready AI voice assistant for Windows desktop automation.

This system combines:

- 🎙 Offline Speech-to-Text (Whisper)
- 🔊 Offline Text-to-Speech (Piper)
- ⚙ Agent-Based Automation Engine
- 🧩 Tool Registry & Executor Architecture
- 🖥 System + File + Application Automation

## 🎙 Voice Capabilities

### ✅ Speech-to-Text
- OpenAI Whisper (GPU enabled)
- English-only transcription
- Deterministic configuration
- Push-to-talk support

### ✅ Text-to-Speech
- Piper TTS (offline)
- Custom tuning parameters:
  - `length_scale`
  - `noise_scale`
  - `noise_w`
- Runtime audio cleanup

---

## ⚙ Automation Capabilities

### 🖥 System Control
- Lock laptop
- Shutdown
- Restart
- Volume up/down
- Mute

### 📂 File Operations
- Open file
- Create file
- Delete file
- Move file
- Create folder
- Delete folder
- Search file

### 📱 Application Automation
- Open WhatsApp Desktop
- Send WhatsApp message
- Launch applications
- Browser control

All automation tools follow:

BaseTool → ToolRegistry → Executor


This allows easy addition of new tools without modifying core logic.

---

## 🧩 Agent-Based Execution Model

Each command is converted into:

python
ToolCall(
    name="file.open",
    args={"path": "C:/Users/..."}
)
Then executed through:

Executor → ToolRegistry → Tool.execute()
No hardcoded spaghetti IF-ELSE chains.

🛠 Setup Instructions
1️⃣ Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link
cd AI-Based-Voice-Enabled-Intelligent-System-Assistant
2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Run Assistant
